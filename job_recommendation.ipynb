As a Trust and Safety Machine Learning Engineer, you will work to train models which detect harmful behaviors and help ensure user well-being. You will apply your technical skills to uphold our principles of safety, transparency, and oversight while enforcing our terms of service and acceptable use policies.ResponsibilitiesBuild machine learning models to detect unwanted or anomalous behaviors from users and API partners, and integrate them into our production systemImprove our automated detection and enforcement systems as neededAnalyze user reports of inappropriate accounts and build machine learning models to detect similar instances proactivelySurface abuse patterns to our research teams to harden models at the training stageYou May Be a Good Fit If YouHave 4+ years of experience in a research/ML engineering or an applied research scientist position, preferably with a focus on trust and safety.Have proficiency in SQL, Python, and data analysis/data mining tools.Have proficiency in building trust and safety AI/ML systems, such as behavioral classifiers or anomaly detection.Have strong communication skills and ability to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.Care about the societal impacts and long-term implications of your work.Strong Candidates May Also Have Experience WithMachine learning frameworks like Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorchHigh-performance, large-scale ML systemsLanguage modeling with transformersReinforcement learningLarge-scale ETLAnnual SalaryThe expected salary range for this position is:$340,000 - $425,000 USDLogisticsEducation requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.How We're DifferentWe believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact \\u2014 advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI \\u2014 rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.Come work with us!Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

The Waymo Driver powers Waymo One, a fully autonomous ride-hailing service, and can also be applied to a range of vehicle platforms and product use cases. The Waymo Driver has provided over one million rider-only trips, enabled by its experience autonomously driving tens of millions of miles on public roads and tens of billions in simulation across 13+ U.S. states.The Driver Understanding and Evaluation team at Waymo develops a rich understanding of Waymo Driver's behavior. With over 1 million driverless miles per week, it is critical that Waymo can understand and assess the behavior of all its vehicles - both in the field and in simulation - with automated algorithms. The learned metrics team is a strategic bet to use machine learning to ensure we can scale to meet Waymo's goals. We collaborate across teams to bring ML to production systems and build what is Waymo's reward function. We build and operate large-scale machine learning and data systems, simulation workflows, and insight tools.

Onboard existing repositories as they enter the monorepo, including harmonizing their homegrown toolchains with our standardized offers. Expand B&amp;R support to accommodate new languages. We currently support Java and Scala, and are expanding to Python. Support teams with company-wide migrations and version upgrades, such as build and runtime environment versions and library versions. Work alongside company-wide build experts to incorporate existing company-wide tools into our environment. Create measurement harnesses to measure build performance, mean time to failure, and other critical developer velocity metrics. We Would Love To Work With You IfYou have at least four years of experience directly managing build, CI/CD, and release tooling, preferably in a monorepo context in which these offerings are provided as a service You have proficiency in managing large projects in Gradle as well as cross-language build tools such as Bazel or Pants You have experience developing build and release operations for large repositories featuring dozens to hundreds of independent but interlinked projects You have extensive experience with Java and/or Python B&amp;R methodologies You have a passion for evolving B&amp;R best practices in response to empirical performance and developer velocity measurements Our compensation structure consists solely of an annual salary; we do not have bonuses. You choose each year how much of your compensation you want in salary versus stock options. To determine your personal top-of-market compensation, we rely on market indicators and consider your specific job family, background, skills, and experience to determine your compensation in the market range.
